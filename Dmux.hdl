IN in, sel;

PARTS:

//First we flip the selector bit for future use.
Not(in=sel, out=notsel);
//Second, we check if the input and selector are both true.
//If they are, then output pin b becomes true.
And(a=in, b=sel, out=b);
//Lastly we check if both a and not the selector are true.
//If they are both true, then output pin a becomes true.
